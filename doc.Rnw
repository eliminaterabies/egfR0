Estimates of canine rabies's intrinsic reproductive number (\rzero), a metric of disease spread, from a wide range of times and locations are relatively low (values $<2$), with narrow confidence intervals.

We combined incidence data from historical outbreaks of canine rabies from around the world with high-quality contact-tracing data from Tanzania to investigate initial growth rates (\littler), generation-interval distributions (\G), and reproductive numbers (\rzero).

\section*{Introduction}

Canine rabies, primarily spread by domestic dogs, is a vaccine-preventable disease that continues to cause tens of thousands of human deaths every year in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
\citep{taylor2017difficulties, minghui2018new}.
Canine rabies has been effectively eliminated from high-income countries by mass dog vaccination \citep{rupprecht2008can}.
Despite the effectiveness of dog vaccination, rabies continues to cause many human deaths and large economic losses in LMICs due to the limited implementation of rabies control strategies \citep{hampson2015estimating}. 
The past two decades have seen an increase in rabies control efforts, including dog vaccination campaigns and improvements in surveillance \citep{kwoba2019dog, mtema2016mobile, gibson2018one, mazeri2018barriers, wallace2015establishment}.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and partners (OIE, FAO, GARC) joined forces to support LMICs in eliminating human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 \citep{minghui2018new, abela20162016}. Mass dog vaccination campaigns have begun in some LMICs and are being scaled up \citep{castillo2019socio, evans2019implementation}.
However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic disrupted rabies control and elimination efforts \citep{nadal2022impact}.
As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is transitioning out of global emergency, rabies control programmes are slowly resuming.
% https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies
An understanding of rabies epidemiology --- in particular, reliable estimates of the basic reproductive number (\rzero), a quantitative measure of disease spread that is often used to guide vaccination strategies --- could inform rabies control efforts.

The basic reproductive number \rzero is defined as the expected number of secondary cases generated from each primary case in a fully susceptible population \citep{macdonald1952analysis}.
Estimates of \rzero using various methods (direct estimates from infection histories, epidemic tree reconstruction, and epidemic curve methods) based on historical outbreaks of rabies have generally been surprisingly low, typically between 1 and 2 with narrow confidence intervals for a variety of regions and time periods \citep{hampson2009transmission, kurosawa2017rise, kitala2002comparison}. 
With such a low \rzero one might expect rabies to fade out due to a combination of behavioural control measures and stochastic fluctuations, even in the absence of vaccination.
In contrast to diseases with a large \rzero (e.g., rinderpest, with \rzero $\approx 4$ \citep{mariner2005model}), \rzero estimates for rabies suggest that control through vaccination should be relatively easy.

% \rzero estimates for rabies using various methods (i.e., direct estimates from infection histories, epidemic tree reconstruction and have been consistently low, with narrow confidence intervals \citep{hampson2009transmission}.
Here we revisit and explore why rabies, with its low \rzero, nonetheless persists in many countries around the world. 
Such persistence suggests that rabies's potential for spread, and therefore the difficulty of rabies control, may have been underestimated. 
We will combine information derived from epidemic curves with a high-resolution contact tracing data set that provides large number of observed generation intervals (rare for infectious disease studies) to estimate \rzero.
%% This reassessment can reevaluate the estimation of $\rzero$ for rabies outbreaks and understanding of disease control more generally.
%% \mr{I think the "more generally" part desserves a bit more preamble/evidence... maybe this is a bit late to get to the general overall, although this may depend where you're publishing and the hopes that this can spur rabies vaccination campaigns} \mli{Happy to get rid of it.}

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\rzero is often estimated by combining two other epidemiological quantities: the initial growth rate of an epidemic (\littler) and the generation interval (\G) distribution, where the generation interval is defined as the time between successive infections along a transmission chain \citep{park2018exploring}.
The initial growth rate \littler is often estimated by fitting a model to time series data from the early stages of epidemics.
\G is an individual-level quantity that measures the time between an individual getting infected to infecting another individual.
The generation interval distribution is the natural way to link \littler and \rzero \citep{wallinga2006generation, champredon2015intrinsic}.
During an outbreak in a  fully susceptible population,
\bmb{Not sure we need the first clause here? $\littler$ implies that we are at the beginning of an outbreak?}
\rzero can be calculated from \littler and the \G distribution
by the Euler-Lotka equation \citep{wallinga2006generation}
\begin{equation}
\rzero = \frac{1}{\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} G(t)e^{-rt}},
\label{eq:EL}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is time, and $G(t)$ is the generation interval distribution.
This formula is convenient to calculate point estimates of \rzero; however, researchers rarely propagate uncertainty from the estimates of \littler and the \G distribution through this formula.

\subsection*{Initial growth rate}

Disease incidence typically increases approximately exponentially during the early stages of an epidemic. The initial growth rate \littler is often estimated by fitting exponential curves from near the beginning to near the peak of an epidemic.
However, growth rates estimated from an exponential model can be biased downward, overconfident, and sensitive to the choice of fitting windows \citep{ma2014estimating}.
Here we used logistic rather than exponential curves to more robustly estimate \littler \citep{ma2014estimating, chowell2017fitting}.
%% \mr{This seems like such a big piece of the difference between KH and WZLi estimates; I'm surprised it only gets mentioned here in M\&M but not highlighted in abstract/methods. Especially since KH is an author, seems fine to be more firm in claiming logistic is more appropriate and likely to resolve some of the "paradox"\\ } \mli{Added a few words in the abstract.}

%\mr{code-formatted variable names may be alienating, maybe describe in more conventional terms with either just words, or mathy variable names?}
We selected fitting windows algorithmically for each outbreak as follows: (1) we break each time series into “phases”: a new phase starts after a peak of height at least \code{minPeak} cases followed by a proportional decline of at least \code{declineRatio}; (2) In each phase, we identify a prospective fitting window starting after the last observation of 0 cases and extending one observation past the highest value in the phase (unless the highest value is itself the last observation); (3) we then fit our model to the cases in the fitting window if (and only if) it has a peak of at least \code{minPeak} cases, a length of at least \code{minLength} observations, and a ratio of at least \code{minClimb} between the highest and lowest observations. We tried a handful of parameter combinations before settling on a final set during an expert consultation. These explorations are detailed, and the final choices noted, in our code repository.

\subsection*{Observed Generation intervals}

Transmission events are hard to observe directly for most diseases.
An earlier, influential rabies paper constructed estimated generation intervals by summing two quantities: a latent period (the time from infection to infectiousness), and a wait time (time from infectiousness to transmission) \citep{hampson2009transmission}.
Since clinical signs and infectiousness appear at nearly the same time in rabies, the incubation period (the time from infection to clinical signs) is routinely used as a proxy for the latent period.
\citeauthor{hampson2009transmission} randomly and independently resampled latent (really, incubation) periods and infectious periods from empirically observed distributions \citep{hampson2009transmission}, and then sampled waiting times uniformly from the selected infection periods.

However, constructing \G values by summing independently resampled values of incubation and infectious periods accounts neither for the possibility of multiple transmissions from the same individual, nor for correlations between time distributions and biting behaviour.
\fref{intervals} illustrates the generation intervals of a single transmission event from a rabid animal (comprising a single incubation period plus a waiting time) and multiple transmission events from a rabid animal (comprising a single incubation period and three waiting times).
\bmb{the commented-out statement here seems important?}
% To account for multiple transmission, the incubation periods needs to be reweighted by the number of transmissions.
For diseases like rabies, where transmission links (and generation intervals) are observable, multiple transmissions and possible correlation structures are all implicitly accounted for within the observation processes through contact tracing.
%\mr{I'm confused by the "implicitly accounted for"; why not simply explicitly observed?}

Once the infectious period (grey block) starts, there is a wait time (solid black line) until a susceptible host (solid red circles) is bitten. The infectious period ends with the death of the focal host (black X).

\subsection*{Correcting for vaccination}

In a population where some animals are not susceptible, calculations based on estimates of \littler and the \G distribution (\ref{eq:EL}) estimate the \emph{realized} average number of cases per case, also known as the effective reproductive number \re.
In the case of rabies, vaccination is the only known cause of immunity (case fatality in dogs is believed to be 100\%).
For a given population with $\nu$ vaccination proportion, the estimated $\rzero$ with vaccination correction is
\begin{equation}
\rzero = \frac{\re}{(1 - \nu)}.
\label{eq:RE}
\end{equation}

We used data from December 2002 -- November 2022, from an ongoing contact tracing project in Tanzania \citep{hampson2008rabies, hampson2009transmission}.
The data set contains \Sexpr{dogsTransmissionNum} domestic dog recorded events (i.e., domestic dogs bitten by an animal), and \Sexpr{dogsSuspectedNum} suspected rabid dogs in the Serengeti, Tanzania.
Transmission events were documented through retrospective interviews with witnesses, applying diagnostic epidemiological and clinical criteria from the six-step method \citep{tepsumethanon2005six}.
Each dog was given a unique identifier, and date of the bite and clinical signs were recorded if applicable and available.
\Sexpr{nrow(dogsUnknownBiter)} of the dog transmissions were from unidentified domestic animals or wildlife.
We restricted our analysis to domestic dog transmissions (i.e., dog to dog), and obtained \Sexpr{countVec["Generation Interval"]} directly observed generation intervals (i.e. both biter and secondary case have ``time bitten" records).
There were four observed dogs with multiple exposures (i.e., bitten by different identified biters), generating extra generation intervals, but it is unclear which transmission event transmitted rabies to these dogs.
For simplicity, we omitted these four dogs and their generation intervals from our analysis.

To propagate uncertainties for both \littler and \G, we used a hybrid approach.
We first fit logistic models, with negative binomial observation error, to incidence data to estimate \littler implemented in the R package {\tt epigrowthfit} \cite{epigrowthfit}.
We then compute a sample of \Sexpr{nsamp} $\hat{\rzero}$ values using equation (\ref{eq:RE}).
For each value of $\hat{\rzero}$, we first draw a value of $\hat{\littler}$ from a Normal distribution matching the estimated sampling distribution of the logistic fit parameters and an independent sample of \G from the empirical contact tracing data. To sample \G from the empirical contact tracing data, we first take a weighted sample of \Sexpr{nboot} biters, which accounts for biter-level variation, and for each biter, we sample a \G from its respective transmission event, to account for individual variation.
We then matched samples of \G to the \littler samples to produce a range of estimates for \rzero.
This hybrid sampling approach incorporates the uncertainties in both \littler and \G
in the distribution \rzero estimates.
Finally, we use the 2.5, 50,  and 97.5 percentiles of the distribution of \rzero estimates to get point estimates and confidence limits for $\rzero$ for each rabies outbreak.

\Fref{GISI} shows the empirical distributions of the observed incubation periods, rabid dog biting frequency, and generation intervals from contact tracing data.
The mean observed incubation period is \Sexpr{signif(meanVec["Incubation Period: Dogs"],3)} days (n = \Sexpr{countVec["Incubation Period: Dogs"]} dogs), the mean biting frequency is \Sexpr{signif(mean_biting_freq,3)} bites per rabid dog, and the weighted mean incubation period is \Sexpr{signif(meanVec["Weighted Incubation Period"],3)} days (n = \Sexpr{countVec["Incubation Period: Biter"]} biting dogs).
The mean observed generation interval is \Sexpr{signif(meanVec["Generation Interval"],3)} days (n = \Sexpr{countVec["Incubation Period: Biter"]} primary infections resulting in \Sexpr{countVec["Generation Interval"]} secondary cases), which is substantially larger than the mean generation interval constructed from independently summing incubation periods and wait times (24.9 days \citep{hampson2009transmission}).
The weighted incubation period distribution more closely resembles the generation interval distribution than the incubation period of all dogs.

We estimated \littler from historical outbreak data (\fref{littler}). 
For a direct comparison of the method used in \citep{hampson2009transmission}, we also estimated \littler from an exponential model. Both methods (exponential and logistic) were applied to all phases of the global historical outbreaks. 
Overall, \littler estimates from the logistical model are larger with wider confidence intervals compared to \littler estimates from the exponential model (i.e. the estimation method used in \citep{hampson2009transmission}).

We combined our estimates of \littler from the logistic model with the empirical \G from our detailed Tanzanian data to produce \rzero estimates.
Of the listed historical outbreaks, four occurred in locations with prior rabies vaccination coverage: Memphis, US (1947, 10\% vaccine coverage); Serengeti, Tanzania (2003, 20\% coverage); Ngorongoro, Tanzania (2003, 20\% coverage); and Sultan Hamad, Kenya (1992, 24\% coverage).
%\mr{presumably, Memphis, TN. I think there is a Memphis in TX, OH, NY, NB, MO, MS, MI, IN, FL, and AL as well. }
\fref{Rzero} shows the \rzero estimates using various approaches along with estimates from \cite{hampson2009transmission}. 
Our estimates of \rzero using the logistic model and corrected \G are larger than those previously reported \citep{hampson2009transmission}, with 3 locations (Java, Memphis, and Mexico) having \rzero greater than 2.
The hybrid approach provides larger values of \rzero and wider confidence intervals after propagating uncertainty from both \littler and generation interval distributions with upper confidence intervals greater than 2 for most locations.

% \mr{you set up the idea that R0 should vary across populations, but I don't think very clearly yet (density seems like a good one, since the idea behind R0 is that it includes both the contact rate and the transmission rate). But you use a single region to estimate generation intervals... can you state a bit about why this seems like a fine assumption (i.e., something like you expect similar variation in dogs within and across populations -- even though the other paper is all about how important the dog-to-dog variation in latent period is for understanding dynamics?)

Lastly, we compare the effects of different estimation techniques of \littler and \G on estimates of \rzero (\fref{mexico}). 
For illustrative purposes, we used the 1987 outbreak in Mexico where there was no vaccination. 
Propagating uncertainty from both \littler and \G generally leads to wider confidence intervals compared to previous \rzero estimates in \citet{hampson2009transmission}.
The \rzero estimate increases when we estimate \littler via the logistic model, or when we sample the full distribution of \G, rather than plugging in the naive constructed interval as in \cite{hampson2009transmission} .
 \rzero estimates increase even more when we included both corrections (i.e., in \littler and \G), with even larger uncertainty. 

\section*{Discussion}

Our study resolves the mystery of why rabies persists despite the fact that \rzero estimates in historical outbreaks have been consistently low, by showing that substantially higher basic reproduction numbers are compatible with historical outbreak data.
Here, we reanalyzed historical rabies epidemics with improved model assumptions and uncertainty propagation, showing that historical estimates of \rzero were downward biased and overconfident.

The basic reproductive number, \rzero, is commonly used to summarize the risk of infectious disease and to inform control measures. Here, we used a relatively simple approach to estimating \rzero by combining initial growth rate (\littler) estimates from incidence data and generation intervals from contact tracing data.
By assuming rabies generation intervals are similar across time and space, this method allows us to combine generation intervals from the detailed Tanzania contact tracing data with growth rates estimated from incidence data from various regions across the globe. 
We improved on earlier work by correcting for slowdown in epidemic growth when estimating \littler, and by developing an approach to propagate uncertainty from both \littler and \G, resulting in higher \rzero estimates with wider confidence intervals.

Estimates of \rzero are strongly affected by estimates of the growth rate during the initial phase of the epidemic.
The logistic model gives a better approximation of the initial phase of the epidemic resulting in a larger estimate of \littler compared to the exponential model \citep{ma2014estimating}.
Our estimates of \littler account for observation error (measurements may not perfectly match reality), but not for process error (the fundamental stochasticity of the system itself). Thus, there may be more uncertainty in \littler than we estimate \citep{king2015avoidable}.
%\mr{is the point here to contrast with the way you used a more complete distribution of G to account for process error on that side of the equation?}

Re-analysis of these data also allowed us to identify an overlooked fact about rabies generation intervals: observed generation intervals are longer, on average, than intervals constructed by naively adding incubation period and waiting time, because of within-individual correlations in time distributions and biting behaviour. The unexpected importance of these correlations could have implications for \G-based studies of other infectious diseases, as such correlations can bias the estimation of generation intervals, as shown in this study. Further investigation of how these correlations affect the overall dynamics of rabies is warranted.

Nevertheless, our estimates suggest that rabies \rzero may be larger, and more uncertain, than previously thought.
This finding may explain some of the formerly unexplained variations in the success of rabies-control programs (e.g., low levels of coverage (30–50\%) have been successful in some settings while high coverage 75\% was not enough to control rabies in others \citep{eng1993urban}).
While our primary goal was to understand why estimates of rabies \rzero were small with narrow confidence intervals, our analysis also revealed an interesting biological process through the lens of generation intervals from contact tracing data: the need to account for biting behaviour in the incubation period distribution, in order to match the generation interval distribution.
 
\rzero is typically used as a first approximation for interventions such as vaccination to determine herd immunity thresholds. 
However, both heterogeneity in contacts and the correlations between incubation periods and transmission that we observed here through the generation interval suggest that simple \rzero estimation methods may be inadequate and should be used with caution. 
Rabies is a nice system to highlight this effect because transmission events and latent periods are observable and directly recorded with contact tracing. The correlation effect we observed here may be important in other  disease systems in general, despite the fact that generation intervals are not always observable and uncertainties may be even greater.

%\mr{not sure which paper is destined to come out first, or if you're subitting them (i.e., this one an correlations paper) together somehow... I think there could be a more explicit linking between the two papers. I think the sentence Ben suggested you refine could be more positive: you advocate estimating R0 with uncertainty propagation (and also why logistic is more appropriate than exponential, and how general you think that should be. I don't love landing on the mechanistic fitting suggestion; think it would be good to end on strong sentences focused on take-home messages.) Consider moving most of last paragraph up to first in discussion. I think more can be said about how Rabies is a nice model system because latent period and transmission events are so easy to observe, and natural immunity is not thought to exist, but your findings can be applicable in disease systems where the uncertainties in generation interval may be even greater, or something like that.}
