=================

We are having problems.

check.Rout is reporting many-to-many warnings when merging biters. Likely cause is repeated IDs in biter df, which seems bad.

egfR0.Rout is not currently running at all (this was suppressed under slow machinery). This is also correlated with an m-to-m issue.
