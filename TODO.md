=================

We have no Hampson estimate for NYcounties, nor for Tokyo 1948. Do we know why? Can we just drop them? WZ to do some research then check in with Katie.

Split slow/ and shared/; we seem very confused, e.g.:
* msvals is completely $#@!ed -- depends on bitten.rda, which is not even supposed to exist anymore!
* Should probably also worry that nothing in the workflow shows this break; although it's kind of an edge case that we can still produce bitten.rds...?
