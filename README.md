### re: make
To run code in this repo using the Makefile, use shellpipes
remotes::install_github("dushoff/shellpipes")
https://dushoff.github.io/shellpipes/

To pull and push (on git) idiomatically, simply run in terminal `make sync`.



### other R packages
I think I installed epiGrowthFit manually/outside the make file, but don't
recall -MER 20240130

## Documents and documentation
- `TODO.md` contains some long-term desiderata from JD
- `notes.md` contains meeting notes from meetings primarily between JD, KH, and ML
- `README.md` (this document) is where MR is writing user notes as he gets to know the project...
- `Makefile` describes workflows. 
- Not in this repo, but to understand the **make** workflows, it may help to see the **shellpipes** package documentation: https://dushoff.github.io/shellpipes/. for more, https://github.com/mac-theobio/useMakestuff
- `makestuff/README.md` has lots of **make** documentation
